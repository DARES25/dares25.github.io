    <h1>DARES Workshop at ECAI 2025: AI-driven Data Engineering and Reusability for Earth and Space Sciences </h1>

    <p>The Earth and Space Sciences are characterised by an exponential growth in data volume and complexity, and are derived from diverse sources such as satellite imagery, in-situ measurements, and simulations. Alongside AI, Europe invests heavily on Earth Observation and Space Programmes. Through Copernicus, a flagship initiative of the European Union, as well as via considerable and sustained contributions towards EUMETSAT, ESA, ECMWF and elsewhere, Europe has become a hub for high quality data and services. These programs, supported by substantial financial and technological resources, provide a crucial foundation for advancing scientific understanding, addressing global challenges and fueling innovation. This abundance of data presents both unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and significant challenges in data management, analysis, and interpretation.</p>

    
    <p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers exploring how AI methods, including machine learning, symbolic approaches, and their intersection, can be effectively applied to transform, explain, fuse, or otherwise prepare large and complex datasets from diverse sources within Earth & Space Sciences for use and reuse in downstream applications. In addition, the workshop will welcome contributions on AI-powered semantic data annotation and metadata enrichment, due to their significance in improving data discoverability, understandability, and reusability. </p>
